# Pythagorean-Theorem
In this repo I am analyzing what is known about the Pythagorean Theorem. It includes different proofs and applications. The main Jupyter Notebook is ```PythagoreanTheorem.ipynb```, which states the history of the theorem, its importance, proofs, etc. An application of the Pythagorean Theorem (specifically Euclidean distance) is presented in ```PlayerClusteringByPosition.ipynb```, where the position of football players is determined using Euclidean Distance. The dataset with the statistics of football players is located at ```PlayerPlayingPositionData.csv```.

## Table of contents of ```PythagoreanTheorem.ipynb```

1. History of the Pythagorean theorem
2. What is the theorem and why is it so important?
3. Various proofs of the Pythagorean theorem
4. Euclidean distance
5. Applications of the Pythagorean theorem and Euclidean distance
6. Conclusion
